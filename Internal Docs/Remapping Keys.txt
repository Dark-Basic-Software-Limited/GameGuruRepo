1. Navigate your Windows Explorer to here ""Steam\steamapps\common\Game Guru\Files\editors\keymap"
2. Right click on default.ini and select Copy
3. Left click beneath the file and select Paste
4. Rename the file to 'mykeymap.ini'
5. Now open SETUP.INI in "Steam\steamapps\common\Game Guru" using Notepad (any text editor)
6. Find and edit the line "fulldebugview=0" to read "fulldebugview=1"
7. Save the file and then run GameGuru
8. You will now see debug text on-screen due the above flag change
9. When you press a key you will see the kscancode value change. This shows you the true value of the key pressed.
10. Now open 'mykeymap.ini' in Notepad so you can edit it
11. Change any of the key entries in this file to new keys you want to trigger
12. For example, if you want to assign forward to S and backwards to W you would change two lines in the file like this from:

 key17W         = 17
 key31S         = 31

to this:

 key17W         = 31
 key31S         = 17

Therefore making the computer think W was pressed when in fact S was pressed. You can remap all keys this way.
