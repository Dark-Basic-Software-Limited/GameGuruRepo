represent the computer controlled players within the AI system and
they will move and react according to their surroundings and the
values of their parameters. These parameters can be set using
commands beginning <I>AI Set Entity ___</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
and retrieved using </SPAN><I>AI Get Entity ___ </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">and
usually have no immediate impact on the entity until an event occurs
that they need to react to, such as discovering an enemy. The
commands beginning <I>AI Entity ___</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
are more like commands to the entity to tell it to do something and
usually have an immediate effect on the entity's movement, depending
on their current mode.</SPAN></SPAN><BR><BR>Entities have two main
modes of operation, <I>automatic mode</I> and <I>manual mode.</I> The
default is automatic mode where an entity will react according to its
stance, which can be one of <I>Run Away, Stationary, Cautious</I>, or
<I>Aggressive</I> (see <I>AI Set Entity Stance</I>). In manual mode
you are free to instruct the entity to behave and move where you want
by using the range of manual mode commands, which provide much of the
functionality that automatic mode uses to move entities around. <BR><BR>In
both modes entities automatically avoid obstacles and other entities
in their current container when moving about, without a need for a
separate collision system. However, dynamic obstacles such as crates
should not be added to the AI system, instead use an external
collision/physics system to detect collisions with dynamic obstacles
and use <I>AI Set Entity Collide.</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
</SPAN><BR><BR>Entities are grouped into three teams, the player's
team, the enemy team, and a neutral team. The player's team help the
player by attacking enemies, enemies attack the player and its
allies. Neither will attack neutral entities, and neutral entities
will not attack anyone.</FONT></P>
