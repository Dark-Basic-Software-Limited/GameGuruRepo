ENTITY ADD TARGET<BR></B><BR><FONT SIZE=3>This command will add an
entity or player (<I>Target ID</I>) to another entity's target list
(<I>Entity Number</I>) which will then be regarded as a valid target
and fired upon as if the target was an enemy of the entity. The
target will remain in the target list whilst the entity can see the
target and for a short time after. Once the target has been lost for
a certain amount of time it will be removed from the target list and
will not be re-added unless it is re-spotted and is naturally a valid
target or you add it again.<BR><BR>For example, normally enemy
entities will only attack friendly entities or the player, but using
this command you can add enemy entities to each others target lists
and they will attack each other so long as they can see each other.
To create a free for all style scenario you can create a group of
entities, all on the same team, and use the <I>AI Get Entity Can See</I>
command to check if each entity can see any other, and if so to add
it to the target list using this command. <BR><BR>If the target
already exists in the target list it will not be added again, so this
command can safely be used many times on the same target. If you want
to remove a target from the list before it loses sight use the <I>AI
Entity Remove Target</I> command. The target does not have to exist,
if it does not no change is made.<BR><BR>Entities are allowed any
number of targets in their target list and it will be sorted
automatically to select what the entity thinks is the biggest threat
to it at the time, this is mostly based on distance.</FONT><BR></FONT><B><BR>Syntax<BR></B>AI
