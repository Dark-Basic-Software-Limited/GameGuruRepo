path holds a list of points which can be used to describe a route in
the order the points are defined. The main purpose for this is to
assign patrol routes to entities, but they can also be used as a
simple structure for holding a list of unrelated points.<BR><BR>You
can create create a path between two points that will take into
account any obstacles in the way, allowing you direct access to the
path finding system. Such paths will follow waypoints and valid edges
between them to build up a complete path. If the start or end points
are inside obstacles attempts will be made to find the closest point
outside the obstacle (this may fail where multiple overlapping
obstacles create a difficult solution).</FONT></FONT></P>
