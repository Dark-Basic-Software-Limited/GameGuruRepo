# The GameGuru Classic Repository

This is not open source and remains the copyright of The Game Creators Ltd, see Wiki for more information on license matters. This repository contains a 64-bit version of Classic as the master trunk, and an older version under the 'VS2017-Legacy-JAN2023' branch that used the older VS2017 for compiling.

GameGuru Classic is a 3D game maker for simple first and third person games and is available to buy from Steam. 

Steam Product: https://store.steampowered.com/app/266310/?utm_source=githubrepo&utm_campaign=general&utm_medium=web

You will need the media files associated with the above product to use this repository.

This source code requires Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition. You can get this for free from the Microsoft website.

When installing Visual Studio 2022, ensure you select the "Desktop C++" development track, and tick the optional Visual C++ MFC for x86 and x64 as you will need these additional files to compile the legacy GameGuru Classic executables.

To give you a better idea about getting started, a while ago we made a 12 minute video showing the whole setup process from the very first download to running GameGuru Classic under your own binary creations. This video shows VS2017 being used but the process remains the same.
